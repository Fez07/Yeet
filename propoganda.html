        <p>My name is Theo Constas, I am 19 years old, and I am from Melbourne, Australia, a place that I was born and have lived my entire life in.
  I graduated at Overnewton Anglican Community College and began studying at RMIT in 2021 in a Bachelor of Business course majoring in Marketing.
  I am a 3rd generation immigrant as all my grandparents immigrated from Greece to start a new life in Australia. In my family, I have one younger brother and one older sister, making me the middle child and of course having middle child syndrome. As well in the family we have on dog who is 12 years old, and is a cross breed, being half Shih Tzu, and half Jack Russel.
  I used to find difficulty finding hobbies to stick to but over time I found that I enjoyed Tennis, which however I dropped right before entering senior level competition and instead begun training in the gym for a source of fitness.
  I enjoy spending time with my friends going out drinking or doing activities.
  My goals for the future are to become wealthy to the point where I could pass down wealth to give future generations a somewhat more comfortable lifestyle. Goals for myself are to also explore the world, visiting countries for their unique cultures, languages and nature. <p>

        <p>My interest in business has always led me to the concept of innovation, making society a little better than it currently is. My personal beliefs is that in the modern day, this is achieved through the development of technology, whether or not it is essential or not. My belief is that knowledge in IT is necessary for people who want to go forward into the future with an understanding in how the world works, which is why I attempt to fill my elective classes with subjects that can teach me basics of coding languages or develop my understanding in Information technology.
I believe that in my studies in business and IT, I can go down my own path towards entrepreneurship, and explore my own way to innovate and bring a new service/product to society that can make it that one little bit better, in which I can learn the skills to do so with these classes.</p>
